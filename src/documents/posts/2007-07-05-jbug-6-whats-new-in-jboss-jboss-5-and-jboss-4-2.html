<p>In this session we'll give a short summary for the new products in JBoss - &quot;JBoss AS 4.2&quot; and &quot;JBoss AS 5.0&quot;. JBoss AS 5 is the next generation of the JBoss Application Server build on top of the new JBoss Microcontainer with many key features provided by integrating other standalone JBoss projects. In addition we'll emphasize the motivations and key points of JBoss AS 4.2.0 - the latest GA release of JBoss Application Server ,and a stepping stone from JBoss 4.0 to JBoss 5.0. It combines a lot (but not all) of the exciting new features of JBoss 5, based on the stable 4.x MicroKernel architecture.</p>
