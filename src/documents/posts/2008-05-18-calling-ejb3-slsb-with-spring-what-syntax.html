<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6"><p>I find the Spring 2.5 manual (chapter 18) unclear regarding the syntax that EJB3 clients need to declare in order to be able to call a remote SLSB <b>EJB3</b>.<br /> Should we use a SimpleRemoteStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean (like I was used to doing with EJB 2.1) ?</p><p>Or should we use the &lt;jee:remote-slsb&gt; tag ?</p></span></span></p>
