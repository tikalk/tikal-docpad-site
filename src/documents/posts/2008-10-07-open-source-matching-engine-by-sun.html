<p><a href="http://mural.dev.java.net/">Mural</a> is a new open source project and community for MDM (<span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Master Data Management</span>).</p><p>Mural-DM-DQ (<span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); cursor: pointer;">Data Quality</span>) which provides the capability to match, deduplicate, merge, and cleanse data from various sources and Mural-DM-MI (Master Index Studio) which is a NetBeans plugin that would generate a domain-specific Master Index JEE application.</p><p>MDM was born out of the great pain of the &quot;<span class="yshortcuts">data integration problem</span>&quot;. The classic example is customer information that exists in multiple sources like CRM system, Billing system, Call Center system but each system has a different list of customers, or when different vendor has a different product ids for same products, or different universities give different names to the same courses etc...</p><p>Matching technology is closely related to <span class="yshortcuts">search technology</span>, only that search is based just on keywords in unstructured text and match cares also for the field structure of the data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
