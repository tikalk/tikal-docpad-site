<p>Business Process Management(BPM) and Flow Management Systems have become critical to large organizations over the past several years. Somewhat similar to the OOP paradigm, Process Oriented Programming aims to define and differentiate between different scopes of changes, mainly by defining the Business Process, a key construct widely used in a new language common to both analysts and software designers. JBoss jBPM is a flexible, extensible framework for process languages implementing Flow Management Systems principals. During the technical session, we'll briefly go over Flow Management Systems and take a plunge in JBoss's implementation currently at version 3.2, that includes a Standalone/Web runtime, a full-featured graphical designer, and other supporting tools and technologies.</p>
