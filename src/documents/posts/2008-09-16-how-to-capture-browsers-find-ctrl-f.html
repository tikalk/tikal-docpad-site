<p>Hi,</p><p>Does anyone has an idea of how to capture the browser's ctrl-F in order to override it's behaviour?</p><p>I'm looking for something that works like Google spreadSheets - when you click on one of the cells and ctrl-F, you get a customized find box.</p><p>I thought it's done using BHO , but it doesn't look like it does.</p><p>My ultimate goal is to capture it, and send it to a Flex app for a customized search.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>tnx,</p><p>-Ilan</p>
