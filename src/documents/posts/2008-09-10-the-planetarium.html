wires, blogs and get the
podcasts downloading to try to stay on top of what's going on in the
world of Java for client devices from smartcards to desktops and
everything inbetween.<br />
<br />
What I really need is one blog that pulls it all together each day.<br />
<br />
So I made one. Its called <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theplanetarium">The
Planetarium</a>.<br />
<br />
