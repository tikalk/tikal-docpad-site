<p>This is a continuation of my previous posts describing layers of code written in different programming languages. I have thought about the things involved for a while, and had several discussions with people about it. There were some parts that I didn't describe as well as I thought in my posts, and I will try to do better in this one.<br /><br />The core of these ideas are based on polyglot programming, the thinking that you should use several different languages in a project, based on which languages are better suited for different parts of it. Another term for this concept is Language-oriented programming. So how do you organize a polyglot system? The most natural way for me is to divide it into layers. In most cases you will find that different categories of languages will be better suited to different layers of the application.</p>
