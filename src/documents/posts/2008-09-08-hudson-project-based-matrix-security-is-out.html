<p><em>&quot;One feature that I've been waiting for a long time to see in Hudson is project-level security. To be able to say that certain projects can only be built by certain users. This comes in very handy if certain builds jobs should only be executed by certain people, for security or auditing purposes, for example. A release into QA (or even production) might come under this category.&quot;</em></p>
