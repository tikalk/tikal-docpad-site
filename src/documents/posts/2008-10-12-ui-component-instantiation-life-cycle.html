<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The component instantiation life cycle describes the sequence of steps that  occur when you create a component object from a component class. As part of that  life cycle, Flex automatically calls component methods, dispatches events, and  makes the component visible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
