<p>hi,</p><p>we have a problem when deploying an EAR on WLS 9.2.2. The EAR specifies application lifecycle event listener in weblogic-application.xml, but the fact is that the event takes about an hour to get fired, and after it does, the server craches... Any ideas/troubleshooting tips welcome...</p><p>Zvika</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
