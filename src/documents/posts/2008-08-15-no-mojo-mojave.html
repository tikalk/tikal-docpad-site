these days. <br />
<br />
Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/dannycoward/entry/no_one_wants_to_look">'No-one
wants to look dumb' campaign for MSN</a>, the <a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/">Mojave Experiment</a> is
squarely from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_taste_test">Pepsi/Coke taste
test</a> school of thought. You know, showing people like you and me
reacting to the product, that kind of thing. This time, with the
additional blindfold that the people testing Vista don't know that it
is Vista,
just that it is the next version of Microsoft's OS. <br />
<br />
For the insomniacs amongst us, the underpinning of the campaign is of
late night informercial genre - you know, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxBIgF9ccE4&amp;feature=related">parade
of unpaid customers</a> of the product <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FR7OcCs1Hs">each of whom has
some unique way</a> in which the product for sale has touched their
lives in a profound and meaningful way. You don't really believe that
they are being truthful, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlPvfXNR1j4">somehow you can't
look away</a>. Each echoing the same key messages of the previous one,
like a rat caught in a wheel. <br />
<br />
A blind test of an OS does not lend itself to before and after photos.
Nor apparently in this campaign, of ever showing a single pixel of
Vista in action. Instead, in the <a href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/">Mojave Experiment</a>, the
exposition is in the reality TV style, the reality being the reaction
of ordinary people to it. Except that, as most reality TV shows, the
reality is selectively edited. Of the claim of 22 hidden cameras (why
hidden ? why 22?), only one or two ever appear to be in use. Worse, the
captured reactions are mostly of the subject watching the screen while
the off camera interviewer drives the demo. The subjects never touch
the computer. They never have to figure out why their wireless
connection isn't working, or where they saved their Word document, or
whether they can trust a download that magically popped up in their
face while they were reading PerezHilton.com.<br />
<br />
You obviously <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGVHzEywke0">never
see them doing this</a>.<br />
<br />
The goal of this campaign is I suppose to show that Vista is
surprisingly good. But it just acknowledges that, whether right or
wrong, many people think its surprisingly bad.<br />
<br />
Almost as surprisingly bad as the choice of campaign.<br />
<br />
