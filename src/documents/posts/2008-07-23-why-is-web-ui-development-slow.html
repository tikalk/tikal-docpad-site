<p><span id="thmr_42" class="thmr_call"><span id="thmr_6" class="thmr_call">Have you ever been a team member in a web framework or web product development? You may have noticed although UI prototyping is a fast process but UI integration is disappointingly slow. Have you thought why does this happen? Is it because of not using MVC design pattern and templating technologies? Is it because of poor code quality, tight time frame or ever changing requirements? </span></span></p>
