Comet, on the other hand, allows the server to push data to the client at any time. Comet applications are starting to redefine the capabilities of Web 2.0 applicaions. Bayeux, which is still in daft, is the first standard to define a comet based transport protocol. This talk will discuss the basics of Comet and Bayeux.</em></p>
