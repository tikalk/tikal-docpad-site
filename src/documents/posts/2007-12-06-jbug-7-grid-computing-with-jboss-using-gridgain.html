<p>In this session we will give an introduction to GridGain - a computational grid framework for improving general performance of processing intensive applications, by splitting and parallelizing the workload. We'll show how GridGain can be used to achieve better overall throughput, better scalability or availability of services. In addition we will demonstrate how you can easily write a &quot;grid application&quot; and integrate it into JBoss application server using GridGain.</p>
