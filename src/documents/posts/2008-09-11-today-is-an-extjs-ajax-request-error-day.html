<p>This morning I thought to my self today is going to be a fun day. As we all know programming is fun (some of us tend to be masochists) but not completely stable issue and when we are talking JavaScript some&nbsp; of us will find their way to the coffee table looking for something better to do. (maybe writing a new bean?)</p> <p>Anyway, it's not that I was bored just that I had a task to do and my nature tells me, use FF (FireFox - as to now is my favorite browser, maybe <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts">Google</span></a> Chrome will later change my mind, but we'll see about that) I was writing this kick ass ## code, everything went smooth until, after a while my occipital and <span class="yshortcuts">frontal lobes</span> were telling me to check things on the <span class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed rgb(0, 102, 204); background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Internet Explorer</span>. What can I do the customer pays and we have to follow. Here is where things went wrong and you can take a look in the following links what I'm talking about, :</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers</span></a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp;" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts">http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp;</span></a></p> <p><br /> Try to guess what has happened?<br /> (a) All went smooth.<br /> (b) Some minor issues.<br /> (c) Some big issues<br /> (d) IE.<br /> <br /> </p><p>Ok you might guessed right (c) and (d) are correct.<br /> Anyway after getting my point about IE :)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lets cut to the chace</strong>:</p><p>The problem I faced was about getting an error from EXTJS code, I wrote an AJAX call using EXTJS framework, there is an option in EXTJS AJAX Request when you can pass an existing form element as an argument. The request&nbsp; then uses your form to send its parameters. In this point JavaScript error occured. It took me couple of minutes (half day) until I have realized that my HTML form I was working with had an input with name=&quot;action&quot;. Well, as a fact HTML form element has an action attribute. ExtJS code tried to assign the form's action attribute value (string value) to the input element named &quot;action&quot; and failed as undefined object. Because as we all know in order to assign a value to a form's input element we have to write it like this:</p> <p>document.forms[formName].elements[inputName].value</p> <p>But this problem occured only in IE browser in FF all was good.</p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p> <p>a) Do not use Internet Explorer!</p> <p>b) Avoid using &quot;action&quot; or any other attributes as your form's input name.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
