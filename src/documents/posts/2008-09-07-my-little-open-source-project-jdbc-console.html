<p>&nbsp;This is intended to be used from shell scripts or ant or maven builds to execute SQL scripts. Also it allows to enter SQL commands in interactive mode. In addition to the source code, there is a pre-built binary including all major open-source database drivers. To use Oracle/DB2/MSSQL JDBC drivers you need to download them from the corresponding corporate site.</p><p>Hope to hear your feedback.</p>
