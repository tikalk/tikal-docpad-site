<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6"><p>This is an introductory tutorial to Spring Batch. It does not aim to provide a complete guide to the framework but rather to facilitate the first contact. Spring Batch is quite rich in functionalities, and this is basically how I started learning it. Keep in mind that we will only be scratching the surface.</p>  <h5>Before we start</h5>  <p>All the examples will have the lofty task of printing &quot;Hello World!&quot; though in different ways. They were developed with Spring Batch 1.0. I'll provide a Maven 2 project and I'll run the examples with Maven but of course it is not a requirement to work with Spring Batch.</p></span></span></p>
