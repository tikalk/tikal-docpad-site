Finally, the wait is over and a effective solution has been delivered by a nifty utility, gwtClassRun.</p> <p><img width="275" height="104" border="0" rel="lightbox" src="http://geekyware.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/image11.png?w=275&amp;h=104" alt="image" style="border-width: 0pt; margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 5px;" /></p></span></span></p>
