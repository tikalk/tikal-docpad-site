<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6"><p class="body">This guide walks through Eclipse setup for working with SpringSource Application Platform bundle projects. The easiest way to manage these projects is with Maven 2, and a plugin that integrates Maven project functionality into Eclipse.</p>  <p class="body">At the end of this guide, you'll have a working Eclipse installation that can be used to create multiple OSGi bundle projects. You will be able to run unit tests inside or outside of the container, start up the S2AP server within Eclipse, and debug your bundle code while it runs in-container.</p></span></span></p>
