<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a WAR file (as a BIRT project).</p><p>The WAR has a lib directory, which contains all libraries that are related to BIRT.</p><p>In my BIRT project, in eclipse, I set the paths to use another project.</p><p>I take the other project, JAR it, and add it to the WAR.</p><p>This WAR goes to JBoss.</p><p>When I run something with this WAR (a report if you really need to know),</p><p>I get a java.lan.NoClassDefFoundError ...</p><p>So, is there another tink I shoul update the WAR to recognize the JAR file?</p><p>thanks,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyal G</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
