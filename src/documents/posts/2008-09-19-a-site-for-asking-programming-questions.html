<p>We don't run Stack Overflow. <i>You</i> do. Stack Overflow is <b>collaboratively built and                     maintained by your fellow programmers</b>. Once the system learns to trust you, you'll                 be able to edit anything, much like <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. With your help, we can build good                 answers to every imaginable programming question together. No matter what programming                 language you use, or what operating system you call home -- better programming is                 our goal.</p>
