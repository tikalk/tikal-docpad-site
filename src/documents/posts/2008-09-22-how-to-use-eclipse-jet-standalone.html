<p>Is there a way to run Eclipse JET standalone ?</p><p>Ant Task or Maven Plugin or just source code.</p><p>I need it for code generation out of eclipse ?</p><p>Example from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-JET2/JETCTask.java">http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-JET2/JETCTask.java</a> does not work for me, may be because it was writen for Eclipse 2.</p>
