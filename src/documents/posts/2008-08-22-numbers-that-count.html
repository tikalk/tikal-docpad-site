<img style="width: 182px; height: 321px;" alt="" src="http://blogs.sun.com/dannycoward/resource/reaching.jpg" align="left" />For those of you who know me, I can still get <a href="http://qjmath.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/51/4/451?ck=nck">a
little freakish about numbers</a>. So, from <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javame/mobilemarket/index.html">a
really interesting article about mobile devices and Java ME</a> I saw
over the last week, two numbers stood out for me. For developers trying
to figure out how to reach a wide audience for their application, those
numbers are: <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.7 million</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">zero</span>. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.7 million</span> is the
number of mobile phones that were sold, on average,<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> every single day in
2007</span> around
the world. Now, I *heart* my iPhone, its a wonderful device, but the
iPhone reached the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/08/technology/iphone-3m.fortune/">million
mark 74 days</a> after its launch. That's <span style="font-weight: bold;">74 days</span> to sell as many iPhones as
it took just <span style="font-weight: bold;">9 hours</span> to sell
as many mobile devices. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Zero</span> is the cost of entry to
develop an application for Java ME, which is deployed today on many of
that staggering number of devices (for a complete list, <a href="http://developers.sun.com/mobility/device/device">see here</a>).
No <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2008/07/apples_iphone_c.html">complicated
agreements</a> to get the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/">Java ME SDK</a>, the
development of the platform is <a href="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/">out
in the open</a>, so everyone sees it <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/07/16/Google_offers_Android_updates_only_to_contest_winners_1.html">unfold
at the same time</a>. Better still, the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/javame/index.html">free visual
development environment</a> for Java ME has been <a href="http://www.devx.com/wireless/Article/28559">pretty great</a> for
some time now. <br />
<br />
Two numbers that add up to a great way to reach a lot of people.<br />
