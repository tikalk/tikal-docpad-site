<p>Mate is a tag-based, event-driven Flex framework.</p><p>Flex applications are event-driven. Mate framework has been created to make it easy to handle the events your Flex application creates. Mate allows you to define who is handling those events, whether data needs to be retrieved from the server, or other events need to be triggered.</p><p>In addition, Mate provides a mechanism for dependency injection to make it easy for the different parts of your application to get the data and objects they need.</p>
