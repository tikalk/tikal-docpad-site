<p>Recent years have been pretty exciting and innovative with respect to the applications we see on our browsers. More and more, web pages seem to look and behave like desktop applications, and with presentation needs comes a new range of solutions used by application developers. In this short session we'll review some of the prevalent Rich Application Frameworks that enable development of desktop-lookalike client-side applications and components, sometime with their server-side counterparts. The frameworks(briefly) discussed and compared in this session include: Wicket, GWT, Eclipse RAP, ExtJS, Dojo, Flex, JSF's RichFaces and others.</p>
