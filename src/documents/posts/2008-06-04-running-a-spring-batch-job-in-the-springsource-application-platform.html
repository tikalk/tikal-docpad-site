I ran an early version of this up as a little demo for JavaOne, and then again at the London Spring User Group, and thought it might be a good thing to share. The sample code is <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/batch-ap-blog-v2.zip">here</a>.&quot;</span></span></p>
