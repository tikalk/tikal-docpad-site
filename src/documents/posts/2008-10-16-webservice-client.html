<p>I am trying to consume Web Services of SalesForce.com.</p><p>First of all it was very difficult to find WSDL URL. I found this one - http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/sforce20.wsdl.</p><p>But i am not able to parse this WSDL with Axis2 or Java6 wsimport. I get errors with complaints on SOAP-ENC:Array at namespace <span class="attribute-value">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/<br /></span></p><p>any ideas ?</p>
