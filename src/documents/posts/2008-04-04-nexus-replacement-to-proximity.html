With Nexus you can completely control access to, and deployment of, every artifact in your organization from a single location.<br /> <br /> (Jason van Zyl says that this is a twist of fate: Nexus might be the first Maven-related project with documentation in its first releases.)<br /> <br /> Resources for Nexus include a <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/book/reference/repository-manager.html">chapter excerpt on Nexus</a> by Tim O'Brien, <a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org/getting-started.html">getting started</a>, <a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org/download.html">downloading Nexus</a>, and the <a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p></span></span></p>
