<p>Exadel Fiji extends JSF by allowing the use of Flex with JSF components and within a JSF page. When using Fiji Flex components, developers can use Flex with the same familiar JSF component-based approach to building user interfaces. Check out the <a href="http://livedemo.exadel.com/fiji-demo/">demo page</a>.</p><p>While at it, you may want to check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsf-flex/">JSF Flex project</a>(here's a nice <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=JSFFlex">introduction article</a>), who aims much higher: automatic translation of JSF user interfaces to SWF, with supporting Javascript code for JSON encoding. How cool is that?</p>
