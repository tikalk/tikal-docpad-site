<p>An interesting summary of open source build and development tools made by Matt Raible, just a few days before <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/linkedin_cuts_10_a_k">getting fired as a part of the closing of LinkedIn's Denver's office</a>(starting to feel the earthquake?), including: m2eclipse, Nexus, Hudson and of course Maven itself. The post itself is a summary of a lecture - slides, unfrtunately, not included.</p>
