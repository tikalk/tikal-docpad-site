<p>I have tried to launch the Flex profiler on a web application and it was a bit annoying to find out the following:</p><p>- For some reason it yelled about my browser tabs being enabled. It probably related to FireFox browser but I'm not so sure, even tough my default browser was the IE. I then moved to work with Flex Profiling workspace, on the main menu I have used the Profile menu item -&gt; Profile External Application -&gt; Launch the application manually... It then will connect to the profiler as soon as you load your Flex application.</p><p>- I compiled my application to work with RSL and I got another error about using a none debug version. Compiling my Application to work with RSL instead of the Merged Into Code option made the debug information to be excluded.</p>
