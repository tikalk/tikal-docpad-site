<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6">This five-part <span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 153);">series</span> of articles introduces Acegi Security System and demonstrates how to use Acegi to secure enterprise Java applications. This final article of the series continues a discussion of using Acegi to secure JSF applications. In <span style="color: rgb(92, 129, 167);"><a title=" Part 4" href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-acegi4/" target="_blank">Part 4</a></span> I showed how you can secure a JavaServer Faces (JSF) page using Acegi without writing any Java code. I also provided an in-depth explanation of events that happen when you deploy your JSF-Acegi application and when a user accesses it. This time I focus on techniques for securing JavaBeans in your JSF applications. </span></span></p>
