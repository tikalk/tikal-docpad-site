<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6">The Envers project aims to enable easy versioning of persistent classes. All that you have to do is annotate your persistent class or some of its properties, that you want to version, with <b><code>@Versioned</code></b>.  For each versioned entity, a table will be created, which will hold the history of changes made to the entity.</span></span></p>
