<p>Since Flex 3 was 		      released at the end February 2008 developers have been able to see progress 		      within the Flex SDK by monitoring the <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3c061177/" target="_blank">commit list</a> and downloading nightly or 		      stable builds from the <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/flex" target="_blank">Flex SDK Open Source site</a>. Flex SDK 3.1 is what the team 		      considers a milestone build, a certification of all of that work and a roll-up 		      into a build that is recommended for all users. Flex Builder 3.0.1 is an update 		      that includes the Flex 3.1 SDK along with numerous bug fixes and certified 		      versions of the professional data visualization and testing components.</p>
