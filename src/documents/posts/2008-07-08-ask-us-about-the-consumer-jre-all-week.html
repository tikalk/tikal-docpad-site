a <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/">special
event this week</a> over at the SDN, and its your chance to ask us
anything you feel like about the upcoming Java SE 6 Update 10 release,
aka the 'Consumer JRE'.<br />
<br />
Each day we answer as many of the questions people send in, and they
all get <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/sessions/2008/jl0707.jsp">published
online</a>. Its like a slow motion chat !<br />
<br />
Have you <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/ea.jsp">tried
out the beta</a> yet ? (nearly a million people already have)<br /><br />
