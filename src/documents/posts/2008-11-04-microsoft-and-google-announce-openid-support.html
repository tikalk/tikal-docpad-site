<p>This is a historic week for OpenID. Google and Microsoft announced the release of code to support OpenID 2.0 across their most important properties. On Monday, Microsoft, <a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/10/27/421.aspx?ref=/2008/11/03/openid-japan-launches-with-32-member-companies/');" href="http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/10/27/421.aspx">announced</a> OpenID 2.0 support for their 460 million users on the LiveID platform.  On Wednesday Google <a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/10/google-moves-towards-single-sign-on.html?ref=/2008/11/03/openid-japan-launches-with-32-member-companies/');" href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/10/google-moves-towards-single-sign-on.html">said</a> it will be supporting OpenID 2.0 for any user that has a Google account. Both of these deployments are great news for the OpenID community and the Internet at large. It can be safely said that within the coming months, every single user on the Internet will have an OpenID.</p>
